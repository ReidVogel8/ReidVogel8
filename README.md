- 👋 Hi, I’m Reid Vogel and I'm currently a student at Montana State University. I will be graduating soon with a degree in computer science.
- 🌳 Outside of coding, things I like to do include hockey, skiing, and being outdoors.
- 📚 I’m currently learning computer systems and security at MSU. These are two classes that I'm currently taking that interest me and would like to persue.
- 🤝I’m looking to collaborate on things that will help me improve my skills no matter the topic.
- 📫 You can reach out to my email - rwvogel8@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've worked at a ski area for 6 seasons.
